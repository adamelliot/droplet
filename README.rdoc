= droplet

A simple Sinatra app that allows uploading of files via Paperclip, and shows them in a convient list. Mostly so I have somewhere to dump stuff, and to link stuff from my Heroku sites. Eventually it will have tagging support and directly support uploading with paperclip from other apps, but it's still pretty alpha. Uploading uses basic HTTP Auth.
